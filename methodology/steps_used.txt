1. Acquisition of Disk Image:
   - The provided disk image (NPS 2009 Casper-RW) was downloaded from the Digital Corpora repository.
   - The integrity of the image was preserved by keeping it in a read-only state.

2. Initial Triage:
   - Autopsy was used to gain an overview of the file system.
   - The case was created with the data source set to the .dd disk image.
   - File types, partition layout, and filesystem metadata were reviewed.

3. Live File System Examination:
   - Autopsy’s browser interface was used to explore allocated files.
   - Suspicious directories, user profiles, document files, and browser traces were inspected.
   - Timeline and metadata views were referenced to understand user activity patterns.

4. Detection of Deleted Artifacts:
   - The Sleuth Kit (TSK) command-line tools were used to list all files, including deleted entries.
   - The `fls` command generated a full index of the file system.
   - Deleted file entries were filtered and stored in DeletedFileList.txt.

5. File Recovery:
   - `icat` was used to recover selected deleted files by referencing inode numbers.
   - Recovered artifacts were placed in the “deleted/” directory for analysis.
   - Focus was placed on document files which could contain personally identifiable or operational data.

6. Content Analysis:
   - `strings` was used on recovered files to extract readable text patterns.
   - Autopsy keyword search was used to verify file relevance.
   - Any document containing meaningful user-generated content was listed in DeletedDocs.txt.

7. Documentation of Output:
   - A full file listing from the image was exported as FileListing.txt.
   - DeletedFileList.txt included only deleted artifacts identified.
   - DeletedDocs.txt included recovered documents that appeared relevant, sensitive, or user-generated.

8. Reporting:
   - Findings from Autopsy and command-line analysis were combined.
   - The final report summarizes observed activity and provides a structured breakdown of recovered artifacts.
